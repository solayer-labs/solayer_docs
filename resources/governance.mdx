## Overview

Solayer currently uses Realms to conduct our governance and proposal voting. LAYER token holders may engage in voting for proposals hosted on our Solayer governance page on Realms.

You may find our Solayer governance page on Realms using the link below:

## Proposals

All governance proposals will be hosted on Realms, with our full proposal hosted on GitHub linked under every Realms proposal.

Realms allow for flexible changes to our governance parameters, our Solayer governance page parameters can be found here on Realms under Settings.

Full proposals are archived in our Solayer public repo here: [https://github.com/solayer-labs/solayer-improvement-proposal/tree/main/governance](https://github.com/solayer-labs/solayer-improvement-proposal/tree/main/governance).

### How proposals work

1. The core team drafts a proposal in Realms.
2. The draft opens for voting the moment it is published.
3. A proposal passes when 70% of the votes cast support it and the vote window (up to six days) closes.
4. After a 12-hour cool-off, anyone can press Execute to trigger the on-chain instructions.

### Proposal types

**Community vote** – Any wallet that has deposited LAYER can vote. These proposals control key decisions surrounding tokenomics and network upgrades.

**Council vote** – Only wallets holding a council token can vote. Used for urgent fixes or routine operations.

For a deeper look at the different types of proposals, see the Realms documentation below:
[https://docs.realms.today/proposal](https://docs.realms.today/proposal)

## Voting

LAYER tokens are required to vote for governance proposals. Voting weight directly corresponds to the LAYER each user locks on the governance contract.

### How to Vote

1. Go to the Solayer governance page on Realms: [https://v2.realms.today/dao/AYgtQCZGaYZywkAT7fWDGWeL3hzaXCgB72WcWaNgpgbt/proposals](https://v2.realms.today/dao/AYgtQCZGaYZywkAT7fWDGWeL3hzaXCgB72WcWaNgpgbt/proposals)
2. Connect your wallet on Realms, and click "Connect" on the wallet pop-up message.
3. Click on **Deposit** under **My Governance Power** to deposit LAYER tokens for voting.
4. Under **Proposals**, click on any proposal to see more information, or vote directly by clicking **Vote** on any proposal.
5. If you have clicked on a proposal, under **Vote Now**, click on any of the voting options (Yes, No, or Abstain), and click **Vote** to cast your vote.
6. Approve your transaction to submit your vote.
7. (Optional) Under **Discussion**, leave a message in the discussion thread.

### How to delegate your LAYER

Delegation lets you assign the voting weight of your deposited or locked $LAYER to another wallet while you keep full custody of the tokens. You can revoke or redirect this power at any time.

1. Open the Solayer DAO on Realms.
2. In the **My Governance Power** panel choose **Delegate**.
3. Paste the delegate's wallet address, then approve the transaction in your wallet.

Ensure that you have LAYER already deposited or locked in the governance voting contract and a small amount of SOL for network fees.

### How to change or remove a delegate

Return to the same panel. Click **Clear** to revoke, or paste a new address to switch delegates, and sign again.
