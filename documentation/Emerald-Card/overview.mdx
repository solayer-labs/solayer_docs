# Solayer Emerald Card: Your On-Chain Lifestyle, Unlocked

The wait is over. The Solayer Emerald Card is now live – available to 40,000+ users and fully integrated with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Visa’s global network.

Spend USDC like cash, earn real on-chain rewards, and finally experience the real-world utility of crypto.

<br/>

## Global, Visa-Compatible, Fully On-Chain

Use the Emerald Card at over 150M+ merchants in 200+ countries, withdraw local currency from ATMs worldwide, and pay with just a tap.

- Spend directly from USDC — no pre-conversion  
- Apple Pay & Google Pay supported  
- ATM withdrawals for local cash, globally  


<br/>

## Your On-Chain Checking and Savings in One

Think of Emerald Card as your crypto-native financial hub. Deposit USDC to spend instantly or opt into sUSD — a Treasury-backed stablecoin offering 4–5% yield.

- Instantly mint/redeem sUSD (no lockups, no minimums)  
- Non-custodial and fully on-chain  
- Seamlessly switch between spending and saving  

Even $5 of sUSD earns real yield. It’s like a savings account — but on the blockchain.
