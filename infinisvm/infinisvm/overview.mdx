## **InfiniSVM**
### **The Next-Generation High-Performance Blockchain**

Solayer InfiniSVM is a breakthrough blockchain architecture designed to scale a single, global state machine with **unprecedented throughput, near-zero latency, and robust composability**. Unlike conventional scaling methods that rely on vertical scaling or fragmented sharded rollups, **Solayer InfiniSVM** maintains atomic state transitions by **distributing workloads across microservices and specialized hardware accelerators**.

## **Performance at the Limits of Hardware**
Solayer InfiniSVM pushes blockchain performance to the limits, targeting:

- **1M+ Transactions Per Second (TPS)**  
- **100Gbps+ Network Bandwidth**  
- **Ultra-Low Transaction Latency**  

With below architecture, Solayer supports **next-generation applications that demand high throughput, low fees, and seamless composability**—empowering both developers and users.

## **Key Innovations in Solayer InfiniSVM**

### **Hardware-Accelerated Execution**
Solayer offloads critical blockchain operations—including **signature verification, transaction filtering, pre-execution simulation, scheduling, and storage**—to distinct, **highly optimized hardware clusters**. This division enables **massive parallelization** and eliminates bottlenecks in transaction processing.

### **Ultra-Fast Communication with InfiniBand RDMA**
To achieve near-microsecond inter-node communication, Solayer integrates **InfiniBand RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)**, enabling extreme-speed data transfers and minimal overhead across the network.

- Leverages RDMA & Infiniband
- Bypasses traditional os network stacks
- Enables remote memory operations
- Minimizes CPU involvement

### **Software-Defined Network**
Software-Defined Network (SDN) architecture separates the control plane from the data plane, enabling programmable, high-performance blockchain networking. By leveraging a logically centralized controller, Solayer achieves real-time network optimization, dynamic routing, and efficient transaction propagation at scale.

- Programmatic network control
- Custom protocol implementation
- Maintains line-rate performance

### **Multi Executor**
Solayer’s Multi Executor is **sharded across multiple nodes**, allowing for **massive-scale account data storage with optimized load balancing**. This ensures high efficiency and reliability, even under extreme network conditions.

- Speculative transaction execution
- Fine granied scheduling 
- Database sharding with RDMA
- Concurrent transaction exeuction


### **Hybrid Consensus: Proof-of-Authority + Proof-of-Stake**
Solayer employs a **hybrid Proof-of-Authority (PoA) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism**. Transactions undergo **speculative execution before reaching the sequencer**, minimizing re-execution delays while maintaining security and finality.

- Proof of Authority +  Proof of Stake
- Megaleader + decentralized group of verifiers 
- Fallback consensus on Solana

## **Enhanced Developer & User Experience**

### **Composable Hooks for On-Chain Automation**
Developers can **embed post-transaction logic directly within the chain** using **Solayer Hooks**. This enables **automated arbitrage, liquidations, accounting, and more**, making smart contract interactions smoother and more powerful.

### **Advanced Transaction Features**
- **Jumbo Transactions**: Aggregate multiple operations into a single execution.  
- **Cross-Chain Calls**: Seamless interoperability across multiple blockchain ecosystems.  
- **Built-in OAuth Support**: Simplified authentication and user onboarding.
