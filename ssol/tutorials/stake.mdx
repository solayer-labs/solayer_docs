## Step 2: Enter the Amount of SOL to Stake

Ensure the `sSOL` tab is selected. Enter the amount of SOL you wish to stake.  
You will see the current exchange rate below the input field (e.g., `1 sSOL = 1.0684 SOL`).  
Once a valid amount is entered, the **Stake** button will become active.

## Step 3: Approve the Transaction

Your wallet will prompt a confirmation window.  
Review the transaction details, including:

- Amount of SOL to be staked
- Expected sSOL to receive
- Network fee (e.g., `0.00041 SOL`)

Click **Approve** to proceed.

## Step 4: Transaction Pending

Once approved, a pending status will appear on the Solayer interface as the transaction is processed on the Solana network.  
This typically completes within a few seconds.
