Solayer is building a vertically integrated financial stack for the open internet.

Powered by *InfiniSVM*, our hardware-accelerated blockchain engine, Solayer delivers unmatched performance, up to 1,000,000 transactions per second (TPS) while providing a seamless on-chain to real-world experience through native assets, DeFi tools, and the Emerald Card.

# 1,000,000 TPS

At the heart of Solayer is *InfiniSVM*. Built with technologies like RDMA, InfiniBand, software-defined networking, and a multi-executor model, it enables near-zero latency and horizontal scaling for the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

Software alone has reached its limits when it comes to scaling. That’s why we believe the future lies in hardware acceleration.

InfiniSVM makes Solayer the fastest blockchain in production—ready to support real financial use cases at scale.

## Vertically Integrated Stack

Solayer is more than just a blockchain. It’s a fully integrated financial system.

From base-layer infrastructure to real-world payments, every component is designed to work seamlessly together. This vertical integration enables frictionless capital flow across:

- Core assets like `sSOL` and `sUSD`
- DeFi tools designed for scale
- On-chain spending and payment via the Emerald Card
