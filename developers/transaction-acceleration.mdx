title: "Transaction Acceleration"
---

Stake-weighted Quality of Service (SWQoS) is a key part of improving the network performance of Solana dApps, and Solayer has opened a free public Stake-weighted Quality of Service (SWQoS) endpoint for Solana projects and builders.

Simply publish your transaction to the endpoint by calling the sendTransaction RPC method and we will forward it as a regular Solana transaction to our SWQoS infrastructure.

Acceleration Endpoint:
```https://acc.solayer.org```

The parameters for the RPC call is the signed transaction as a base-58 encoded string.

```
const body = {
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    method: "sendTransaction",
    id: 1,
    params: [
        tx
    ],
};

try {
    const response = await axios.post(`https://acc.solayer.org`, body);
    console.log(response.data);
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error.response.data);
}
```

Sample code for how builders can broadcast transactions to our endpoint can also be found in our CLI tool [here](https://github.com/solayer-labs/solayer-cli/tree/main/swqos).
