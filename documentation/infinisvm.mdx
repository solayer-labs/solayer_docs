description: Next-generation blockchain architecture with unprecedented throughput and ultra-low latency
---

## Architecture Philosophy

InfiniSVM scales a single global state machine by distributing workloads across **microservices and specialized hardware accelerators** while maintaining **atomic state transitions**. This approach avoids the fragmentation issues of traditional sharded or rollup-based scaling.


## Welcome to Solayer InfiniSVM

Solayer InfiniSVM is a next-generation blockchain architecture designed to scale a single global state machine with **unprecedented throughput, ultra-low latency, and strong composability**. Built with hardware acceleration at its core, InfiniSVM delivers **1M+ TPS** and enables next-gen applications that demand high throughput, low fees, and seamless composability.

## Performance Targets

- **1M+ TPS**: Sustained transaction throughput (currently achieving 340k+ TPS in devnet)
- **100Gbps+ Bandwidth**: Network capacity for high-throughput data processing
- **Microsecond Latency**: Ultra-low inter-node communication
- **Atomic Composability**: No fragmented state
- **Solana VM Compatible**: Deploy existing Solana programs with minimal changes

## Hardware-Accelerated Execution

Solayer offloads critical blockchain operations to distinct, highly optimized hardware clusters:

- **Signature Verification**: Dedicated verification accelerators
- **Transaction Filtering**: Pre-execution validation and filtering
- **Simulation**: Transaction outcome prediction
- **Scheduling**: Intelligent transaction ordering
- **Storage**: High-performance distributed storage

This division enables **massive parallelization** and eliminates bottlenecks in transaction processing.

## Network & Communication Layer

### InfiniBand RDMA
Near-microsecond inter-node communication through:
- Remote memory operations without CPU involvement
- Bypassing traditional OS network stacks
- Zero-copy, high-speed data transfers

### Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
Programmable network control enabling:
- Dynamic routing and traffic optimization
- Custom protocol deployment
- Consistent line-rate performance at scale

## Execution & Consensus

### Multi-Executor Architecture
Sharded execution across multiple nodes with:
- Speculative transaction execution
- Fine-grained scheduling
- Database sharding with RDMA
- Concurrent transaction processing

Learn more: [Multi-Executor →](/documentation/introduction/system-architecture/multi-executor)

### Hybrid Consensus (PoA + PoS)
Combines Proof-of-Authority with Proof-of-Stake:
- Megaleader model with decentralized verifiers
- Speculative execution before sequencing
- Fallback consensus secured by Solana

## Network Access

### Mainnet RPC Endpoint

For production applications:

```bash
https://mainnet-rpc.solayer.org
```

Configure Solana CLI for mainnet:
```bash
solana config set --url https://mainnet-rpc.solayer.org
```

### Devnet RPC Endpoint

For testing and development:

```bash
https://devnet-rpc.solayer.org
```

Configure Solana CLI for devnet:
```bash
solana config set --url https://devnet-rpc.solayer.org
```

<Note>
The devnet is specifically for **testing purposes only**. As we're in the internal devnet phase, the network may be intermittently unstable and the blockchain state might be reset during performance upgrades.
</Note>

### Compatible Tooling

InfiniSVM works with standard Solana development tools:
- Solana CLI
- Web3.js
- Anchor
- Other Solana SDK libraries
