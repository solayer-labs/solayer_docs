description: Get devnet SOL tokens for testing and development
---

The Solayer Devnet Faucet provides developers with devnet 0.1 SOL to pay for fees while deploying programs or testing transactions on the Solayer devnet. 

<Note>
This faucet is **only available on devnet** and is intended for **testing and development purposes**. For production applications, use the mainnet RPC endpoint: `https://mainnet-rpc.solayer.org`
</Note>

## Receive Devnet SOL using the CLI

### 1. Configure your Solana CLI

First, check your current configuration:

```bash
solana config get
```

Set your RPC configuration to Solayer's devnet (for testing):

```bash
solana config set --url https://devnet-rpc.solayer.org
```

### 2. Request an Airdrop

Use the following command to request an airdrop of 0.1 SOL (devnet) to your wallet:

```bash
solana airdrop <insert wallet address> --url https://devnet-rpc.solayer.org
```

<Note>
This airdrop command only works on the devnet endpoint and is for testing purposes only.
</Note>

Replace `<insert wallet address>` with your development wallet's public key.

## Receive Devnet SOL using Solayer's Block Explorer

For a more user-friendly experience, you can use the faucet interface on Solayer's block explorer:

1. Visit [Solayer Block Explorer](https://explorer.solayer.org)
2. Navigate to the Faucet section
3. Enter your wallet address
4. Request your 0.1 devnet SOL

<Note>
Each wallet address can receive 0.1 SOL per request through either the CLI or block explorer interface.
