title: Mega Validator & endoAVS
---


Solayer's Mega Validator architecture is uniquely designed to support on-chain decentralized applications (dApps), which we refer to as **endogenous Actively Validated Services (endoAVSs)**.

Unlike traditional platforms that primarily focus on **exogenous AVSs** (such as oracles and bridges), Solayer enhances the capabilities of **native Solana dApps** by providing:

- **Increased probability of securing block space**
- **Prioritized transaction inclusion**

This approach enables developers to build more **responsive** and **efficient** applications within the Solana ecosystem, leveraging Solayer's **stake-weighted quality of service (swQoS) mechanisms**.

## Mega Validator: Enhancing Solana's Validator Performance

### What is the Mega Validator?

Solayer's **Mega Validator** is a specialized validation mechanism designed to **offload hardware signatures**, boosting **transaction throughput** and **reducing latency**.

### How It Works

- **Hardware Signature Offloading**  
   - By shifting cryptographic verification tasks away from standard validators, the Mega Validator **frees up processing power** for transaction execution.
   
- **Enhanced Throughput & Lower Latency**  
   - By reducing signature verification overhead, Solayer’s Mega Validator increases **network efficiency**, allowing more transactions to be processed per second.

- **Seamless Integration with swQoS**  
   - When combined with **Stake-weighted Quality of Service (swQoS)**, Mega Validator **prioritizes transactions dynamically**, ensuring **optimal resource allocation** based on stake.

<br />

## What is an AVS?

Solayer introduces a novel approach in blockchain infrastructure: a system where **decentralized applications (dApps) dynamically allocate processing power** based on staked tokens. This **stake-weighted** model allows dApps to **influence network operations proportionally to their stake**, resulting in **faster and more reliable transactions**.

<br />

## Endogenous AVSs (Actively Validated Services)

Solayer introduces **endogenous AVSs**, which are **native Solana dApps** that can:

- Secure necessary **block space**
- Prioritize transactions based on **delegated tokens**

By leveraging Solayer’s **swQoS**, dApps gain **better control over their network performance**, leading to **superior user experiences**.

## Technical Implementation: Stake-weighted Quality of Service (swQoS)

The foundation of Solayer’s performance improvements lies in **Stake-weighted Quality of Service (swQoS)**, a mechanism that allows dApps to:

- **Reserve blockchain space and processing power**
- **Enhance network efficiency and reliability**

For more details, refer to our [Stake Weighted Quality of Service](assets/mega-validator/transaction-acceleration/swQoS) documentation.

By leveraging **Solayer's Mega Validator and swQoS**, developers can **build next-generation Solana dApps** with superior **efficiency, responsiveness, and prioritization**, setting a new standard for blockchain scaling.
