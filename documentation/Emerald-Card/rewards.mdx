# Emerald Card Benefits

The **Solayer Emerald Card** now includes two powerful benefits: a **points-based rewards system** and **Solana ID-based tiered discounts**. Here's everything you need to know.

---

## Emerald Rewards Program

Earn points every time you spend with your Solayer Emerald Card.

### How It Works

- For every **$1 spent**, you earn **1 Emerald Point**.
- Your **monthly spend** determines a **points multiplier**:

| Monthly Spend (USD) | Multiplier | Points per $1 |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| <$100                | 1x          | 1              |
| $100–$499            | 2x          | 2              |
| $500–$2499           | 3x          | 3              |
| $2500+               | 5x          | 5              |

You can view your **30-day spending history and reward chart** on the [Solayer Dashboard](https://app.solayer.org/card).

> **Note:** Emerald Points will be redeemable soon for partner perks, future airdrops, and other exclusive utilities.

## Solana ID Integration
