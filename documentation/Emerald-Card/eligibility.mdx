## Why Are These Regions Restricted?

The restrictions are in place due to a combination of international sanctions, regulatory requirements, and compliance measures aimed at ensuring **financial security** and **legal adherence**.

- **Sanctions and Embargoes** – Countries subject to economic or trade sanctions that prevent financial services from being offered.
- **Regulatory Compliance** – Certain jurisdictions have regulatory environments that do not align with the operational or compliance framework of the Solayer Card.
- **Security Considerations** – In some cases, geopolitical instability and financial crime risks contribute to the restrictions.

## Future Availability

Solayer continuously reviews **regulatory developments** and **market conditions**. If any changes occur that allow expansion into currently restricted regions, updates will be provided through **official Solayer communication channels**.
