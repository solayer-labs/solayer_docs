# Native SOL Staking Overview

At **Solayer Labs**, our core strength lies in deep engineering of blockchain infrastructure, especially on **Solana** and **SVM technologies**. This document provides an overview of our validator and staking infrastructure, specifically designed for **institutional partners** evaluating the performance, yield, and integration potential of our systems.

<br />

## Solayer Validator

We operate a **high-performance Solana validator**, optimized both on the hardware and software levels to maximize staking returns.

### Hardware-Level Optimization
- Located in a **key data center in Ashburn, VA**, near subsea fiber cables.
- Equipped with **enterprise-grade hardware**, fiber optic networking, and custom infrastructure.

### Software-Level Optimization
- Optimized validator node code to **maximize leader block rewards**.
- These rewards are **shared with institutional partners**, enhancing staking returns.

<br />

## Performance

- **13+% APY** historical returns to the Solayer sSOL stake pool.
- Institutional partners benefit from:
  - **0% commission**
  - **100% MEV kickback**
  - **2–4% additional APY** from shared leader block rewards

## Integration Guide

Stake delegation is simple, whether you're using CLI tools, code-based integration, or UI platforms.

### Method 1: Solana CLI
```bash
solana delegate-stake \
  --stake-authority <KEYPAIR> \
  <STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> \
  SLaYv7tCwetrFGbPCRnqpHswG5qqKino78EYpbGF7xY \
  --fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```
- Replace `<KEYPAIR>` and `<STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` with your credentials
- Full guide available via [Anza](https://docs.anza.xyz/cli/examples/delegate-stake)

### Method 2: JavaScript/TypeScript
Use `@solana/web3.js` to create and delegate a stake account programmatically. A sample snippet is included in the full developer guide [here](https://docs.solana.com).

### Method 3: Web-Based UIs
You can delegate directly from any of the following platforms:
- [Stakewiz → Profile → Delegate](https://stakewiz.com)
- [Solana Compass → Profile → Delegate](https://solanacompass.com)
- [Solana Beach → Profile → Delegate](https://solanabeach.io)
