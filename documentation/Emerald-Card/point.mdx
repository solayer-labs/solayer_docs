## Emerald Card Benefits

The Solayer Emerald Card gives you more than just spending power. Get rewarded with every purchase through:

- **Emerald Points** – earn points for every transaction

- **Nubit Genesis Rewards Program** – unlock special rewards for early users

<br/>

## Emerald Points

Earn points instantly every time you spend with your Solayer Emerald Card.

### How It Works

Every transaction earns points based on the **amount spent** and a **multiplier** applied **per transaction**:

| Transaction Amount (USD) | Multiplier | Points Earned per $1 |
|--------------------------|------------|------------------------|
| Less than $100           | 1x         | 1                     |
| $100 – $499              | 2x         | 2                     |
| $500 – $2,499            | 3x         | 3                     |
| $2,500 or more           | 5x         | 5                     |

**Examples:**

- A $500 transaction earns **1,500 points** (500 × 3x)  
- A $3,000 transaction earns **15,000 points** (3000 × 5x)

You can track your transaction history and points on the **Solayer Dashboard**.

> *Note: Emerald Points will soon be redeemable for partner perks, future airdrops, and other exclusive utilities.*
