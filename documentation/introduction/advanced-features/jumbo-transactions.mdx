title: "Jumbo Transactions"
---

To enable **high-complexity transaction logic**, especially for **hook-based transactions**, **InfiniSVM** introduces **jumbo transactions**. This new transaction type **extends the transaction size limit**, allowing for **greater cross-program execution capacity** within a single atomic transaction.

## What Are Jumbo Transactions?

A **jumbo transaction** is an **enhanced transaction type** in **InfiniSVM** that enables:
- **Execution across thousands of accounts** in a **single transaction**.
- **Thousands of instructions within a single execution pipeline**.
- **Deployment of multiple programs atomically**, reducing state inconsistencies.

This design supports **complex multi-step operations** that would otherwise require **multiple transactions**, increasing efficiency for **high-performance smart contracts**.

## Fee Model for Jumbo Transactions

Jumbo transactions follow an **exponential fee scaling model**:
- As **transaction size increases**, **fees grow exponentially**.
- This ensures **network resource efficiency** and **prevents excessive transaction bloat**.

## Use Cases for Jumbo Transactions

Jumbo transactions provide **significant advantages** in scenarios requiring **large-scale execution**:

1. **Advanced Hook Transactions**  
   - Hooks can perform **high-volume state updates** across **multiple smart contracts**.  
   - Eliminates the need for **splitting logic across multiple transactions**.

2. **High-Throughput Batch Operations**  
   - Enables **multi-asset swaps**, **cross-chain function calls**, and **on-chain auctions**.  
   - Reduces **latency and gas costs** by **batching execution into a single atomic operation**.

3. **Program Deployment & Upgrades**  
   - Developers can **deploy multiple programs in one transaction**, ensuring **synchronized updates**.  
   - Improves **contract composability** by **allowing direct inter-program calls** during deployment.

**InfiniSVM's jumbo transactions** provide a **scalable, high-throughput solution** for **complex smart contract execution**. By increasing **transaction capacity**, **optimizing multi-step logic**, and **allowing large-scale account interactions**, they **unlock new possibilities** for **DApp development, DeFi automation, and enterprise blockchain solutions**.

With **exponential fee scaling**, **jumbo transactions maintain network efficiency**, ensuring **fair resource allocation** while **supporting next-generation smart contract capabilities**.
