title: "Stake-weighted Quality of Service"
---

Stake-weighted Quality of Service (swQoS) is a core mechanism in Solayer's architecture that governs the allocation of network resources. This system dynamically distributes block space and transaction processing capacity based on the SOL delegated to validators.

## Key Concepts

1. **Proportional Resource Allocation**: Validators receive network resources proportional to their delegated SOL.
2. **Sybil Attack Resistance**: Higher delegations provides increased resistance against Sybil attacks.
3. **Commercial Benefits**: RPC infrastructure operators and validator nodes gain advantages in transaction inclusion and capacity.

## Technical Implementation

The swQoS system operates on the following principles:

1. **Packet Transmission Rights**: A validator's right to transmit packets to the epoch leader is directly proportional to their delegations.
2. **Priority Queueing**: Transactions from larger validators receive priority in block inclusion.

### Example Scenario

Consider two validators:
- Validator A: 2% of staked SOL
- Validator B: 0.2% of staked SOL

In this scenario:
- Validator A can submit up to 2% of packets to the block producer
- Validator B is limited to 0.2% of packet submissions

## Transaction Weighting

In the swQoS system:
1. Each transaction carries a "weight" based on delegations.
2. Higher-weight transactions have a greater probability of inclusion in the next block.
3. Increased delegations correlates with higher quality of service and improved resilience against potential malicious activities from lower-delegation validators.

This mechanism ensures a fair, proportional distribution of network resources, incentivizing higher commitments while maintaining network security and efficiency.
