## Integration Guide
Stake delegation is simple, whether you’re using CLI tools, code-based integration, or UI platforms.

### Method 1: Solana CLI
```bash
solana delegate-stake \
  --stake-authority <KEYPAIR> \
  <STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> \
  SLaYv7tCwetrFGbPCRnqpHswG5qqKino78EYpbGF7xY \
  --fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```
- Replace `<KEYPAIR>` and `<STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` with your credentials
- Full guide available via [Anza](https://docs.anza.xyz/cli/examples/delegate-stake)

### Method 2: JavaScript/TypeScript
Use `@solana/web3.js` to create and delegate a stake account programmatically. A sample snippet is included in the full developer guide [here](https://docs.solana.com).

### Method 3: Web-Based UIs
