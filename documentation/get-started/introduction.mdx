Solayer is building the vertically integrated financial stack for the open internet.

Powered by **InfiniSVM**, our hardware-accelerated blockchain engine, Solayer delivers unmatched performance—**up to 1,000,000 transactions per second (TPS)**—while providing a seamless, on-chain-to-real-world experience through our native assets, DeFi tools, and the Emerald Card.

# 1,000,000 TPS

**InfiniSVM** is the performance engine at the heart of Solayer. Designed with cutting-edge technologies like **RDMA**, **InfiniBand**, **software-defined networking**, and a **multi-executor model**, it enables near-zero latency and horizontal scaling for the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

Software alone has hit scaling limits. The future lies in **hardware acceleration**.

With InfiniSVM, Solayer becomes the fastest blockchain in production, optimized to handle **1 million TPS** and built to power real financial use cases.

## Vertically Integrated Stack

Solayer is more than a blockchain—it's a full-stack financial system.

From base-layer infra to consumer payments, everything is designed to work together, enabling frictionless capital flow across layers:

- **Core Assets** like `sSOL` and `sUSD`
- **DeFi tools** tailored for scale
- **Payment rails** and on-chain spending via the **Emerald Card**

This vertical integration removes friction, reduces latency, and provides a seamless experience—from capital formation to real-world usage.
