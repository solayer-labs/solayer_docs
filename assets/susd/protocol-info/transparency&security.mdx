title: 'Transparency & Security'
---

The technical implementation of sUSD ensures both transparency and security at every stage of the process. 

A dedicated Solana program facilitates transactions, while each market maker has a Program Derived Account (PDA) that securely holds their TBILL balance, ensuring proper management of transactions and assets.

Blockchain transparency is maintained as all transactions and TBILL holdings are recorded on the Solana blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent ledger for participants. This ensures that every movement of assets can be traced, contributing to system integrity.

In terms of Asset Security, market maker vaults (PDAs) provide secure, isolated environments for holding assets, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or mismanagement.
The decentralized nature of the RFQ system further enhances security and transparency by promoting fair pricing and minimizing the risk of market manipulation, allowing participants to operate within a trustless and equitable environment.
