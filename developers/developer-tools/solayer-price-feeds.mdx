# Solayer Token Price Feeds Guide  
This guide explains how to fetch real-time price feeds for `sUSD`, `sSOL`, and `Layer` using [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/).
It is intended for developers integrating on-chain or off-chain price functionality into applications or smart contracts.

<br/>

## Price Feed Sources

Solayer tokens are supported on Pyth Network with live, decentralized price feeds:

<br/>

| Token | Feed Symbol | Pyth Price Feed URL |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| Layer | `Crypto.LAYER/USD` | [https://www.pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-layer-usd](https://www.pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-layer-usd) |
| sSOL | `Crypto.sSOL/SOL::RR` | [https://www.pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-ssol-sol-rr](https://www.pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-ssol-sol-rr) |
| sUSD | `Crypto.sUSD/USD::RR` | [https://www.pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-susd-usd-rr](https://www.pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-susd-usd-rr) |

<br/>

## How to Use Pyth Price Feeds

You can consume these feeds in two ways:
on-chain (Solana programs) and off-chain (apps, bots, bridges, etc).


### 1. On-Chain: Using Real-Time Data in Solana Programs

Solana programs can directly use Pyth's price data via CPI.


**Steps:**
1. Locate the Pyth price account from the links above
2. Pass the price account as an input to your smart contract
3. In the contract, deserialize and access:
  - `price`
  - `confidence_interval`
  - `expo`
4. Always validate:
  - `status == Trading`
  - the publish time is recent enough (i.e. not stale)

<br/>

### 2. Off-Chain: Using Real-Time Price Data

Pyth recommends using `hermes-client` or calling the `get_price_updates` API for secure off-chain usage.

<br/>

#### get_price_updates API (Signed & Verifiable)

To fetch signed, binary-encoded price updates:

```bash
curl "https://hermes.pyth.network/api/get_price_updates?ids[]=Crypto.sUSD/USD::RR&binary=true"
```

This method is suitable for:
- Secure data ingestion
- Cross-chain bridging
- Price verification in backend systems

<br/>

### Deprecated / Not Recommended

- `price-service-sdk` is deprecated and should not be used.
- The `api/latest_price` HTTP endpoint is still functional but not recommended for production use:
  - It is not cryptographically verified
  - It may be deprecated in the future
  - Use only for internal dashboards or quick prototyping
